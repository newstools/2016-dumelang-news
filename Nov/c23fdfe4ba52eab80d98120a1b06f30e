BLOEMFONTEIN - Even though there has been an abundance of rain in the central region of the Free State, water restrictions are still in place to reduce pressure on the dwindling water levels which are currently at an average of 49 percent compared to last year s 65 percent. The intention behind the water restrictions is to ensure that the community has a continuous water supply for a longer period of time while waiting for more rain to fall. The main purpose of water restriction is not to punish the community but ensure a continuous water supply rationally for longer sustenance while penitently acknowledging current rainfall, explained Communications Officer for the Department of Water and Sanitation, Marcus Monyakeni.Watering of lawns and plants using hosepipes including irrigation systems in the form of automated sprinklers, filling of swimming pools, washing cars as well as sweeping pavements using a hosepipe is prohibited under the water restrictions. Local Municipalities and Metros clearly stated that any flouting of these restrictions will result in a fine of up to R20 000. This applies to residential, business and government entities, Monyakeni said.Communities are advised to use the available water wisely as well as reporting leakages in their areas to their Municipalities or the Department of Water and Sanitation. Water restrictions that are in place as imposed by municipalities and metros should be abided to at all times for the sake of positive water conservation and demand management, he said.
