BLOEMFONTEIN- From an early age, Mpho Mbongo had a role model in the police service while growing up in Mmakong, Qwaqwa but little did he know that someday he would be one of the officers awarded for long service of between 30 and 40 years in the South African Police Services (SAPS). The father of three was among the 67 long-serving men and women in blue who were awarded for their loyalty to the SAPS in a highly dignified ceremony held at the Dr Rantai Molemela Stadium recently. I have to say, that was the pinnacle of my career as a police officer. Being acknowledged for the work I have put in, in the presence of fellow colleagues was amazing, said the proud Mbongo.The colonel, who has been working in the SAPS for the past 34 years, currently serves in the Management Intervention Unit and says retirement is the last thing on his mind. It doesn t feel like I have been working for over 30 years because to me every day is a new challenge, he said. Starting out in Hammanskraal where he trained, Mbongo learnt a lot about discipline which is one of the qualities that ensured that he stayed the course in the highly demanding job. There are many opportunities for growth in the SAPS and I would say to anyone who wants to join, it takes a lot of discipline and understanding that you are here to serve, he said. Mbongo said that two of his children had already served between 7 and 9 years in SAPS. I will not take the credit to say that I led them into the force. I was highly surprised when they chose the job, he said.
