BLOEMFONTEIN - The Free State Legislature says it will work closely with the Auditor General (AG) and other Chapter 9 Institutions to address challenges of implementing recommendations made by the AG to municipalities and government departments. Sizwe Mbalo, the deputy speaker of the Free State Legislature, said that the structure is struggling to track resolutions approved by the assembly. Mbalo was referring to departments and municipalities that do not comply with resolutions recommended by the AG and consequently lead to poor audit outcomes. We want to have integrated oversight visits not only to save costs but to also share information with our constituents, he said. Last week, the Consolidated Auditor-General Report for the 2015/16 financial year showed that five departments in the province had regressed. These include Education, Agriculture and the Department of Treasury. According to the AG, Kimi Makwetu, the Free State regressed over the past three years mainly due to slow response by management and the political leadership to the recommendations made as well as the failure to honour their commitments. Mbalo said that legislature will also reel in the office of the Public Protector and Chapter 10 institutions such as the Public Service Commission.Addressing media yesterday at the Southern Life Plaza Building in Bloemfontein, Mbalo said affiliating with the chapters will not only save costs during outreaches but will also improve effective oversight visits. The deputy speaker said that working closer with these two chapters will assist legislature with executing its role of calling members of the executive to account for their portfolios and passing the laws for its province as defined in the Constitution. Mbalo will be meeting with officials of both chapters on a quarterly basis to pan out effective strategies to encourage public participation.
