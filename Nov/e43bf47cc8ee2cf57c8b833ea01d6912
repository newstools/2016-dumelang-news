Selosesha- A mother s touch from a concerned lady police constable gave away Thaba nchu parents illicit drug dealings. According to reports from the police, a Cluster Crime Prevention Operation was launched last Saturday night following information that mandrax drugs were being sold at a house in Zone 4 Selosesha, Thaba nchu. Upon arrival, after knocking without response, a man later arrived at the scene and started swearing at the law enforcement agents. A middle-aged woman later opened the door for police officers, and while a search was being conducted, Constable Motshidisi Mochudi asked a 12year old girl to fetch a blanket to cover the 7months old baby she was carrying. Upon holding the baby, Mochudi felt something on the baby s stomach. When she checked what it was, she found 57mandrax pills with a street value of R3 500 hidden under the baby s pants. The 31-year-old mother and her 41year old husband were immediately arrested for dealing in drugs. Upon being searched, the husband was found with two other mandrax pills on him. The 12-year-old daughter as well as a 7months baby were taken to their grandmother. Both suspects are expected to appear before Thaba Nchu Magistrates Court soon.
