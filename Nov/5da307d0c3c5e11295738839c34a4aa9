BLOEMFONTEIN - based hip-hop duo, The Fraternity, recently released its long-awaited debut album aptly titled Long Overdue. The 16-track album hit the streets last month and made an immediate impact. With the group boasting at least 10 years experience in the game, the album title is self-explanatory. We took this long because we felt that we needed the right time to release an album. In recent years, we were not ready, seeing that we have been through a lot of transitions starting off as five members, then having only three and later just having the two of us, explained one of the group members, Thapelo Zwane, also known as Muzee .Inspiration for their album was drawn from personal experiences and what they have been through together with one of their most recent members being kicked out of the group. The way it ended was something that did not really surprise us. It happened and we moved on because we wanted to focus on our music more than the drama, said Muzee. For their album, the duo collaborated with some of the biggest names in the music industry such as AB Crazy, DJ Capital and Speedsta, to name a few. Working with these people was an honour and we would not mind working with them in future, explained Katlego Ditshidi, aka Slick Dynasty, the second of the two-man group. It takes a while for local people to support us but we are getting support from people who are elsewhere in the Free State as well as South Africa. That support is what keeps us going because it shows that we are doing something right, Muzee said. The hip-hop group hopes to own their own recording studio.
