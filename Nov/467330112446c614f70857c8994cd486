BLOEMFONTEIN - Mthembi Chauque has progressed with his preparations for the upcoming South African Students Race Walking Championship despite the competition unlikely to happen owing to examinations. Although it has not been confirmed if the competition, which supposed to be held in Paarl in December, will go ahead as planned, Chauque is hard at training, looking not only to improve his time record, but also fight for the sport in the World Student event in London. The South Africa and Students Federation is set to make a decision on whether or not the competition will continue as the students exams, which were delayed by the students protests, are currently underway.Regardless, Chauque looks to build on the positive run he endured at the recent South African Race Walking Championship in Cape Town, which gave him an exciting competition. The race itself was awesome, but my time was not great. However, it gave me enough confidence and something to work on. Going to Paarl now, I know what I need to do and where to improve. That s what I love about these local races," Chauque told Dumelang Sport. He added: For the upcoming one though, I m positive and will go out to race hard for the World Students Qualification in London and also defend my Student Championship title. I d hoped to do that in Polokwane and redeem myself, but the race didn't happen. But, I m ready.
