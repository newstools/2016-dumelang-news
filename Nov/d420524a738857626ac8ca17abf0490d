BLOEMFONTEIN Recent rumours that water in the Free State is contaminated with E-coli have been put to rest by the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS), Bloemwater and Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality (MMM). This comes after rumours that the water that was serviced to residents of Bloemfontein was infected with Escherichia coli commonly referred to as E-coli. This is bacteria that normally lives in the intestines of healthy human beings and animals. This prompted DWS, Bloemwater and MMM to test the water at the University of the Free State(UFS) on Monday 14 November. The results, which were released on Thursday 17 showed that there were no traces of E-coli in the water. Results confirmed that the water being supplied meets the standards set by the South African National Standards (SANS) at 241:2015. There is no trace of E-coli and there are no extra dosages of Chlorine that is used in the reservoirs at this stage, explained Marcus Monyakeni, the Communications Officer in DWS. Human and animal faeces may pollute ground and surface water sources including streams, rivers lakes as well as water used to irrigate crops. Some outbreaks have been linked to contaminated municipal water supplies. Pule Mlambo, the Communication and Marketing Manager for Bloemwater, also concurred with Monyakeni saying the rumours about E-coli were baseless. We do not have any evidence that there is E-coli in the water. This is because the water that is in a reservoir is not easily contaminated because the water is clean and so is the reservoir, Mlambo stated.
