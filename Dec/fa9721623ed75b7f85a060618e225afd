DURBAN Outgoing chairperson of the African Union (AU) Commission, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, has urged African countries to follow Rwanda s example and open up their borders to enable free movement of people on the continent. Delivering her final State of the continent address in Durban on Monday, Dlamini-Zuma said the advantages of opening up borders far outweigh the disadvantages. Rwanda was the country that led this move and they opened their borders for all Africans. That kind of policy has seen them increase their tourism by 24% and trade by over 50%. Generally, the free movement of people has more advantages than disadvantages, she said. Dlamini-Zuma argued that people end up staying longer if they are not sure if they will be allowed to come back. "If people are free to move they come in and leave. If they know they can't come back at their will, they end up staying. We are developing a comprehensive protocol of free movement and we are hoping it will be signed by 2018," she added. In the interim, the AU was promoting the use of a 30-day visa offered by African states to Africans. "Hopefully more and more countries will open their borders," she added. Meanwhile, Dlamini-Zuma will be leaving office in two months time after four years at the helm of the continental body.
