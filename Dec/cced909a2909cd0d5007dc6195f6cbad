SASOLBURG Abrahamsrust Nature Reserve in Sasolburg was on fire as the Fezile Dabi Municipality held its annual festival meant to assist in combating the spread of HIV and the stigma attached to the Aids and the virus that causes it. The 13th Annual Fezile Dabi HIV/AIDS Benefit Concert was a star-studded show which attracted people from mostly Free State and Gauteng provinces.The galaxy of stars who performed included DJ Finzo, Ringo, Caiphus Semenya, AKA and Lira, amongst others. The aim of the concert was to raise funds for the Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs) in the district and to support their programmes.The municipality realized that NPOs are closer to the community and have long-running programmes that require resources.A committee was formed after the festival to assist the NPOs in the region to apply for the funds made. Organizations need to submit application forms in order to qualify for funding from the benefit concert. The organization applying for funding of their programmes should speak to the problems of HIV/AIDS in the region. Fezile Dabi HIV/Aids Benefit Concert is a very good cause especially to those who support it and those who benefit from it. The turnout was very good though we were skeptical about the weather but it did not disappoint either, said Thomas Nopeche, the Communications Manager for Fezile Dabi District Municipality. He added that there is also an HIV/AIDS Coordinator who will be working with a qualified organization dealing with the disease and the stigma around it.`
