BETHLEHEM - Nhlahleng Paskalina Mabintsi (87) of Bohlokong near Bethlehem received an early Christmas gift when a five-room RDP house was handed over to her by the Free State provincial government last Saturday. The house was officially handed over to her by the Free State Premier, Ace Magashule, in the presence of ANC Women s League national chairperson, Rejoice Mabudafhasi and Sisi Ntombela, the MEC for Cooperate Governance and Traditional Affairs. I never thought I would be in the new house before Christmas.It took a long time before they gave me a house and it came at the time when I thought I would die before seeing it, said the delighted granny. Apparently, the granny s two-roomed house was demolished six years ago. Mabintsi will now enjoy life in a new fully furnished house with her daughter, Cecilia Mokoena (56) and her granddaughter. According to Mokoena, her mother had to live with her at the rented shack in Romen Street for that period. I am delighted to witness the opening of the house. I never believed that it would happen. Actually, it came at a time when we had lost hope.I have been going up and down fighting with the ward councillor for the house," she said. Mabudhafasi said it was a good sign that during the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children, a male comrade decides to build a house for a senior citizen. Mike Mokoena, the chairperson of Free State Stars, built the house for the granny as per the provincial government s request. This should serve as an example to all young man that women have to be protected. Real men don t beat their women, the chairperson said.
