BLOEMFONTEIN - Following a chaotic academic year, the Central University of Technology (CUT) management announced that the final assessments for 2016 were successfully completed. The main assessments for the year commenced on Monday 7 November and ran until Friday 25 November while the supplementary assessments began on Monday 28 November and ended on Saturday 3 December. Without a doubt, we have achieved what many never expected within this short space of time. While our campuses remain calm during this critical period, we will continue to monitor these developments and challenges and their likely impact on our campuses in the near future, said Professor Henk de Jager who is the Acting Vice-Chancellor and Principal.De Jager commended the students, staff and the Student Representative Council (SRC) for working together with management to bring stability to the institution. It says something about the calibre of students and staff and student, unions and staff leadership at CUT, he said. The final assessment marks will be released on Friday 9 December, while the campus will close for the year on Thursday 15 December. For the new academic year, all campuses will reopen on Tuesday 3 January 2017. The campus was hit by on-going #Feesmustfall protests which saw over 20 students arrested and charged for malicious damage to property, illegal gathering and public violence. These protests also led to the closure of both the Bloemfontein and Welkom campuses and the suspension of academic activities which lasted up to Monday 10 October.
