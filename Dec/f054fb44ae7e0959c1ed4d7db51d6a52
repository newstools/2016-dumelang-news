BLOEMFONTEIN Residents of Mangaung Metro Municipality (MMM) are in for a shock at the end of the month when they receive their water bills owing to increased tariffs that took effect on December 1. The recent increase is said to have been necessitated by the current drought that has seen dam water levels dipping below the average mark. The latest increment will see residents paying R9.95 for using between 0-6 kiloletres of water, while using 7-15 kiloletres will see them paying R22.97. Water usage of 16-30 kilolitres will cost R24.47, 31-60kilolitres will see them getting a bill of R27.42 while anything in excess of 60 kilolitres will attract a bill of R31.08.According to the council, the increment is hoped to limit the usage of the commodity by the residents as they will have to pay more for clean drinking water. Although the metro received some rainfall in the past weeks, this has resulted in only a slight rise in the dam levels, according to the Department of Water Affairs. The combined total of the four dams is estimated to be sitting at an average of 35.9 percent. In addition to the increased tariffs, residents are still restricted from watering lawns, using hosepipes, emptying and filling swimming pools. Residents who have boreholes are encouraged to display the appropriate signage. The metro has also urged residents to report any burst pipes, water leaks and water wastage immediately. This can be done by calling the following: Call Centre: 0800-111-300 or 051-410-6689 (7:00 22:00, 7 days a week); Disaster Management Centre: 051-409-9600 / 051-406-6666 (all hours) and Law Enforcement: 051-405-8771 (all hours).
